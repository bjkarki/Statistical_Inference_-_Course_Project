# Statistical Inference - Course Project

## Instructions

The project consists of two parts:
1. A simulation exercise.
2. Basic inferential data analysis.

You will create a report to answer the questions. Given the nature of the series, ideally you'll use knitr to create the reports and convert to a pdf.
